# National Park Log 
## Application Overview
This application was inspired by my love for travel and need to keep track of which National Park Service areas I have been to as well as maintain a list of the ones I have visited.

I built this application in two weeks initially, using React frontend, Django backend and Bulma for styling. My goals were to incorporate full CRUD functionality with many-to-many relationships, gain a deeper understanding of django REST framework , custom properties, external components and external APIs.

## Tech Used
React Django HTML CSS Bulma

## Intallation Instructions

1. In the terminal, run `git clone git@github.com:Connor-Lopshire/national_park_log.git`
2. Move into the folder you just created cd national_park_log
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. This will bring up a browser window showing the react app, but you won't be able to log into the site or access data without running the database side of this project. To download and start the server, go to `https://github.com/Connor-Lopshire/national-park-server`, and follow the readme there.
6. With server running you can access a pre-existing account wiht username: JoeShmoe12 and password: me - you can also register your own account
